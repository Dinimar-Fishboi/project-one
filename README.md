# Help I'm Bored

## User Story

If I state what kind of activity I want to do, and enter my location, I can see a range of activities that are available to me.
In addition, the local weather of the entered location will be displayed as a background image - indicating if the activity I want should choose be interior or exterior. 

When I enter invalid or null location value, 
then I see an error message.
When I click on "Familiar",
then I see list of previously saved locations
When I click on "Actually, let's clear these" button,
then, my previously saved locations are removed, I could add new locations if I wish.
When I click on previously saved locations,
then no duplicate records are created in local storage.

The purpose of this app is to be a clean, easy to navigate prompt and referral application that provides insight to travelers visiting a local area, new residents looking to acclimatise or find community or provide a method to break the eternal scroll cycle that users can enter when lethargic.

Hence the UI and UX is focused primarily for IOS devices - though naturally fully responsive.
